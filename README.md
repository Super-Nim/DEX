# DEX

A Decentralised exchange built with react and truffle/web3.js

**Will be updated with TypeScript**.

## Project Aim

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the core functionalities of a DEX.

The DEX is pre-funded with tokens to provide liquidity as is the user.

Market orders can be executed against an order book based on its BUY/SELL side. 

Limit orders can be placed against an order book also. The createLimitOrder() function arranges the orders by price and recency using the bubble sort algorithm.

Dai token is the stablecoin of the DEX.

All trades will appear in the order book and the chart.
